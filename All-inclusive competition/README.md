 # "All Inclusive"
## HighTech Hacks
"All Inclusive" was created by Jennifer Chiou and Sarah Dufays in May of 2022.

This was submitted to the High Tech Hacks 2.0 Hackathon.

### Purpose

All-Inclusive’s purpose is to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in both communities and businesses/organizations in order to bring attention to the problems of marginalized communities. We want to increase awareness about not only explicit biases, but specifically the lesser-known unconscious biases that bleed into all aspects of life.

### The Problem and How We Solved it

**Unconscious biases,** also known as implicit biases, are the underlying attitudes and stereotypes that affect our understanding, actions, and decisions in an unconscious manner. Residing deep in the subconscious, they are often unconsciously attributed to another person, or group of people, and affect how we perceive and engage with that person or group. These biases are activated involuntarily and without any awareness or intentional control, and they are different from known biases that individuals may choose to conceal for the purposes of social or political correctness. Some examples are sexism, colorism, ageism, ableism, and conformity bias.

Unconscious bias affects workplaces and organizations by causing unintentional discrimination, which results in poor decision-making. They hamper equal opportunities for marginalized groups in terms of selection and progression to high-level management and leadership roles, and they are huge setbacks in creating a truly diverse and inclusive workplace, since it has been proven that such biases have a significant impact on recruitment, mentoring, and promotions. 

Despite the fact that these biases are unconscious, they aren’t hardwired into our brains––they emerge from the information that we see around us, such as our upbringing, where we have grown up, the social structures that we have been a part of, what kind of people and groups we have been exposed to, what kind of ideas have had an impact on us, and what we see in media around us. Therefore, we can decrease bias by acknowledging and educating ourselves about them: that’s where we come in.

**Here at All-Inclusive,** we want to educate people upon their own unconscious biases to foster individual and community change. 
    Often, biases are formed because of generalizations based on limited or flawed information, so our mission is to bring awareness to the existence of these biases and to encourage people to seek more knowledge on what the biases are, when they form, and how to prevent them. We want to show how the world we live in is built upon a cycle that continuously perpetuates both implicit and explicit biases, but we can break that cycle through self-reflection, community action, and most importantly, collective empathy and understanding.
     Our website focuses on first, informing people about the types of conscious and unconscious bias and how they can affect major decisions and systems. We provide concrete ways for people to inwardly reflect on their own biases and stop their proliferation. Even further, we give solutions for communities and businesses to create diversity, equity, and inclusion on a larger scale––because despite all the good individual change can bring, these biases are deeply rooted in our society, so systemic change is one of the most effective ways to counter them. Thus, our website is key to educating those unaware of subconscious biases and creating a more self-aware society that includes the voices of even the most vulnerable.
